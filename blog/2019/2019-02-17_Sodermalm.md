Description: "I walk around the island of Sodermalm, getting distracted along the way."

This weekend I decided to explore the area or island around me, Sodermalm.  
It was a really sunny day.

I'm continuing the habit of making a big walk in the weekend. It's starting to become a coffee-bar-exploration-day.  
I pick a zone, roughly determine my route and then just do the route with way too much spare time calculated.

I need the spare time to go off course and stop at coffee bars.

I will roughly give my take on the things I encounter while I'm doing this. Not that my take will be anything special, but I'll write it down for my own sake.

Saturday I woke up at 8h30 and cleaned my room, did the laundry, dishes etc., allowing me to start the trip at 12h.  

The first thing I did was already strafe from my main path into the big park, where I already spotted a coffee bar on google maps I wanted to check out.

## Icy paths

When I came across this ice covered uphill path, there was no reason to not go around it.

But I decided to try climbing it anyway, as long as I don't try too hard I won't fall.

I tried for a while but it was really too difficult. I just decided to take a tree to the higher, flat ground. Ice is already slippery enough without an angle.

## Coffee bar 1

The coffee bar I saw on Google Maps seemed to be closed on the weekend. No problem, there was one further ahead.

This one seemed to be a really small coffee bakery shop. I was kind-of hungry so I thought to just get some pastry here.

When I entered I did notice that people were coming from upstairs.

I always try to tell them to communicate to me in English by just saying "I'm sorry?" when they say something in Swedish that I don't understand.  
I pointed to the pastry I wanted, and when she asked "Coffee?" I just said "ok.". Then she said "coffee upstairs".

So I went upstairs with my pastry. The thing I'm really profound of is honesty systems. In most Swedish coffee bars, water is free and when you pay for coffee you can take as much as you want.

I forgot to check for the wifi info. Often this is noted somewhere at the counter or on your receipt. So I tried to read/scan a Swedish newspaper.

Since I wanted to at least refill my coffee once, I decided to go ask her for the wifi. But it seems this one doesn't have one.

Well, maybe I can be productive without wifi. So I decided to just apply some random styling to this blog website. Starting with adding some random stuff, I kind-of settled on the markup you see at the title, first paragraph and last paragraph of each blog post.

## SoFo

I'm always so indecisive of where I want to eat. I want some fair place with decent food for a decent price.

When I left the coffee bar and on my way to the next area, I came across a church and some nice nature around it. Also met a cool squirrel.

There's a popular area in Sodermalm called 'SoFo'. It has a lot of bars, shops etc.

I just wanted to find something to eat, but I just kept walking and coming across new restaurants and places.

Finally settled to grab a snack at a Grill place. It wasn't really that great and I just took the metro back to Hornstull around 17h30.

In Hornstull I just went to the coffee bar which I still like the most, il-caffe. Here I can sit quietly until 19h.

## The route

That's it.
