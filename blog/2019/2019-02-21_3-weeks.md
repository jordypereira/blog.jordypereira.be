# Meet the team

Last week was quiet since a lot of my team went to Vue.js Amsterdam.

The frontend team is quite small compared to the rest of the company.  My mentor, the CTO, is also a frontend developer, but lately he's been in a lot of meetings.  
And that probably won't get any less.

He's the project leader for the main project. Which includes the backend team as well. As the company is one big project, they try to keep their projects in a single repository.

Then there's one full time front end developer, our webpack expert. He sets up all of the projects and makes sure to keep all our dependencies up to date. He likes to explain what he's up to in great detail. Always enjoyable to listen to. Maybe a bit less in the early morning, but I can't down-talk his enthusiasm.

The last member of our small team is someone who only works 50%, which makes it a bit hard to keep up sometimes. Especially since she's been sick lately, when I joined the team. But I'm sure she will keep up.

The company is quite flexible which makes it a bit unpredictable to know who of my team will be in the office.
