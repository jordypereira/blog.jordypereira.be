Monday morning is the big meeting day of the week. At 9AM the company has breakfast and everyone gets together.  
At 10h there's a meeting and the product team discusses everything that they will work on this week, as well as discussing what they did last week.

I arrived at 8h20, got a good breakfast and attended the meetings, which are usually in Swedish but this time they did it in English.

After the meeting it was already lunch time. I went with my mentor to get some lunch to take with us and eat at the office. They say it's expensive in Sweden, but 10 euros for a really decent meal is fine for me.

The first day is mostly getting used to their work tools. It will probably be like this the whole week. I received a MacBook for the 3 months I'm here and have to use Webstorm. The other tools include Jira, Kanban, Trello and Github. Not too much to get used to.

I've already made a very little implementation of an issue in Vue so that's great. The UX designer also uses Zeplin which makes it very easy to implement in CSS.

Cool
