# Drag and Drop editor

The first week is over. It was a very fun experience and the people working at ProReNata AB are really friendly and I get along with all of them.

Been doing a lot of meetings to understand the company, their application and the clients they work with. It's mostly a medical application for schools. That's their niche branch and it's working out quite well.

We're defining a new style-guide and since I love working with Tailwind.css, I had to mention it and try to get it in there, so I could keep working with it. I think I succeeded. The designer and CEO are with me already, so now I just have to discuss it with my mentor, the CTO.

For this new project there are a lot of issues that have been made and a roadmap that we will try to follow. One of the more difficult issues was to make the drag and drop editor.

I had just finished my issue and my mentor asked me if I was up for it. I've never done something like it but I said I wanted to give it a shot. When I asked which library we would use for the drag and drop implementation, my mentor told me we were going to write it from scratch. He had already made a js-fiddle with some dragging, and I could take some code from there to make it.

So that's what I've doing the last half of the week. Struggling with one big issue. Thursday I stayed till 19h because I really wanted to get it right.

I'm happy to say that I finished it Friday at 16h. It probably needs some more improvements but I got it working.

So I went home a bit early on Friday. You can decide when you come in and go at the office as long as you get 40 work hours in a week.

It's a very nice work environment.
