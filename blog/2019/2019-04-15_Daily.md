The sun is shining through my window. Luckily my head is placed at the side of the bed with a wall between the window and the bed.  
So that only feet get lit up. I can feel the presence of the sun, it is warm. It makes me believe that it will be a good, warm day.

I open my curtains and let the sun shine through. The temperature is not of any concern. As long as there is sun, it is a good day.

The sun is shining in my face.

You can get twitter followers by getting retweeted by someone with more followers. I had released my cat donation website on twitter, but not many people got to see it. I chose not to message Emma again, as I hoped she would see it for herself, but she did not and the tweet went unnoticed.

I have bought an annual subscription on Brilliant.org. Which is a combination of brain training and fundamental disciplines like Math, Science and Computer Science. I like to follow the natural path, so I will complete the Mathematical Foundation first.

You really have to think about the exercises. After watching tons of videos I have come to the conclusion that it really is the only way to learn. By doing it. By thinking about it.

Once you make a decision that will be your final answer. If you made a stupid mistake than you gave a wrong answer. There's not turning back on that.

I have always dreamt of being smart. I had a little advantage in life which carried me effortlessly through High School, but that advantage stopped really fast as I didn't have the habit of putting effort in studying. And from now on it's all hard work. Everyone can get there if they just keep working on it.

The sun is still shining in my face.

I have started my own company. Now I have to pay a quarterly social taxes. But I can write invoices to companies and refund taxes.

I will probably take the job with ProReNata from home. Then I can invoice them monthly with my company. I have already been thinking a lot about where I will be staying to work. I need a good work place which is not the place where I hang out or sleep.

One idea is to use the attic in my girlfriends house. I could work from here. Then after work I can still go to one of my parents to eat or sleep. Some days I could just stay there as well, as I'm very welcome there.

I have also finished exporting our generated templates to a PDF with Prince XML. It's very exciting to see the final step to our project coming near.

### The Evening

The sun is still shining, but not in my face.  
The bars have started lining up the chairs in front of their bar, and the people have massively occupied the available spaces. Everyone is sitting outside enjoying the sun.

I didn't feel like going home yet. It was one of those days were I just wanted to walk in the distance for hours. So I went home.

But I decided to not be home yet. I didn't take of my shoes or my jacket. I opened the window and made a coffee. It's as if I'm sitting in a bar. Except that it isn't as loud. Yes, even those coffee bars get loud nowadays.

It's almost easter. The days get less productive. Today was a mixture of working, searching information and chilling.

I have these small moments of focus, where I choose a small task and complete it in one go. That mostly goes together with satisfaction, and I take a moment to browse Twitter or message my friends.

I consider browsing Twitter part of my job. It's getting increasingly difficult to filter through the meaningless posts, but once in a while I find some new Tech or some post raising awareness of something which isn't yet the norm, but should be.

Those little wins make it still worth it for now.

I've been able to complete the most important parts of our project. Your current template gets completely synced in a local state. Nothing is saved until the moment you press that save button. From then on everything gets shot to the server.

I've even managed to get the most important part working, which is rendering an actual pdf.  
Every section of the template has a function to render HTML. This HTML gets combined and served together with an exclusive css file to the server, which converts it into a pdf using prince XML.

All that's left is firing up a real alpha release now, and get some feedback from users.
