Time goes so fast. Everything is taken care of and I have already planned my trip home.

I do miss home. But I'm sure I'll miss Stockholm once I'm gone.

They really embrace the nature here. You'll find beautiful parks everywhere and the water surrounding the city is very calming.

The internship feels like a real job, I get to participate in all the decisions and meetings. They even trust me to be able to perform on my own.

The project that we started on when I arrived is not quite finished.  
After 7 years the company felt like changing colors, so it is time for a redesign. But it's not that easy to just change everything. People don't like change.

So they introduced this side project which is a template creator. Together with this side project they hired a designer. The main project is build on old, robust software with a lot of rules.

This new project had no rules and they could use it to test their new design on.

Working closely with our UX Designer, we brought the designs and specs to life.

The component library already includes all of the main components. The first versions are built but they require some more fine-tuning to be used in the main project.

But the testing and quality assurance can begin. We have built a tag component, a table, list, select, input, alert, button, checkbox, tooltip, modal, dropdown... And there are a lot more to come.

Now we will start implementing these in our project. We have developed a live style-guide in Storybook, where you can test these components and play around with them.

There are a couple more technical things that need to happen in our template editor project.  
I have already made it so that we use the tables to get an overview of all the templates.  
When you select one it loads one in with a lot of sections that you can drag and drop and resize to your likings.

The last part that is left after we import all the new components is getting this to actually export to a PDF or a template that gets filled in. Not sure how that will happen.

I hope we get to finish this project. I have 3 weeks internship left.
