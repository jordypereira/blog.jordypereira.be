## The idea

The easiest way to find an idea is just writing down any problem you encounter in your own life. It really does not matter if it has already been made. You can make it better than they can. (If you're going to spend a lot of time in this, of course you can do some research, but don't let it hold you back to brainstorm about the idea).

## First sketch

I start of by grabbing my notebook. I open up a new page and start writing everything I can think about relating a vague idea I have.

First you start with a short description of your goal. What you want to achieve, very clearly in one or two sentences.

Then you define the problem you're having.

After that you can write down all your features and any technologies you will be using for them.

## The Wireframe

You can just sketch the first layout in your notebook. A raw structure is all you need.

## The Design

Open up Figma and do your best. In this phase you will be thinking too much about colors. Try to hold back on any big design changes.

## The Prototype

You make your first prototype in the framework you chose.
