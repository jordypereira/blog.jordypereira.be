## Summary

After 7 days of meditating, it still doesn't come as easy. My mind is active, cluttered and impatient. I keep wanting it to end. But I can see improvements each day, and I guess this is the result of a mind that has been getting daily stimulation from looking at a screen for extended periods of time.

## Day 1: 17 May 2020

*23h20, Meditated at 09h00.*

It felt very boring. I wanted to be done with it. I was feeling no insights, no special thoughts. Just random stuff scouring my mind.
I'll never make it to 1 hour I thought to myself. Maybe this just isn't for me.

I had to remind myself that this is the buildup. This is an investment. It takes 60 days to get used to it and this is only day 1.

### Posture

Sitting upright is very exhausting and uncomfortable. My legs were also getting sore and I had to switch positions often.

My mind just felt so empty.

## Day 2: 18 May 2020

*Meditated around 07h50.*

It felt endless.

## Day 3: 19 May 2020

*10h19, Meditated at 09h19.*

Sometimes I'm able to get into a flow, where time flies by. Other times I don't.

Got interrupted by Slack notifications from work, coming from my laptop. Better shut that off when meditating.

## Day 4: 20 May 2020

*10h05, Meditated around 07h52.*

It was okay. My mind was mostly empty and I was feeling grounded.

In the back of my mind I can feel some sort of anxiety, the fear or failure, wanting to creep up and take over my thoughts.

I won't give in, I keep believing in myself.

It still feels a bit too long.

## Day 5:  25 May

Went on a trip to an island - Tried to meditate but it wasn't as consistent, so I'm not counting them.

*20h32, Meditated at 16h00, after bouldering and showering. Checked time at 20, 30, 40 and 50 min.* 

I'm good at guessing the time but sometimes I lose track.

Quite an active mind. Switching between focussing on a sound and relaxing. Most of my thoughts are about how relaxed I should be.
"Stop thinking. No, wait.. let the thoughts happen. But not these thoughts."
Quite exhausting to try and follow somebody else's rules / perception on meditating.

So I went back to deciding myself what I want to do during my meditation. I had some cold feet, so I was trying to focus on opening my veins to allow for more blood and heat to get to my feet. This makes me focus on something, and who knows one day I might succeed at it.

Was quite impatient at a lot of times. Trying to tell myself that wishing it to end is not a good thought. It's because I'm disconnected and not present in the moment.

Meditating still feels like a chore, a punishment. My mind doesn't settle after a certain amount of time, and keeps jumping states.

## Day 6: 26 May 2020

*22h39, Meditated at 12h20. Checked time at 40 and 53 min.*

It went decent, lots of different thoughts. Sitting down is starting to get easier.

## Day 7: 27 May 2020

*16h56, Meditated at 10h44. Checked time at 29 min.*

There were a lot of thoughts. A lot of new ideas forming, everything in my mind was being structured and getting a place. There are a lot of things I still have to do, or could do.

After checking the time, I was a bit disappointed, as I expected to have been meditating for longer. It was going too slow.

But after 10 minutes I was able to let go and do nothing, losing myself for a while. Not sure if I just fall asleep or something.
