# The projects: Our own styleguide

The project I'm working on, the Printout Template, inderictly involves 2 other projects.

One is our styleguide which we started working on since last month. I guess the UX designer is also part of our little team, but he also works 50% of the time.

So our UX designer writes specs and designs for the components that we will be using in our projects. One of these components is a Tag component, which I recently fabricated.

Soon I'll be making a Table component as well. But that one is pretty advanced. It covers a lot of use cases, even if it's only the first version.

Before we had our own styleguide, we were using components of an other UI library. The company contributed a lot to that project, but eventually they both went different directions and the branches didn't get merged anymore.

So finally the company decided to completly go our own route.

Right now we're still working in a branch of a fork of the original UI library, but we will have more meetings to discuss the project structure.

In any case, I vote for an indepedent repository!
