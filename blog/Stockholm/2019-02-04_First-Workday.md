## First Workday at ProReNata AB

Monday morning is the big meeting day of the week. At 9AM the company has breakfeast and everyone gets together. 
At 10h there's a meeting and the product team discusses everything that they need will work on this week and discusses the last week. 

I arrived at 8h20. Got a good breakfeast and attended the meetings, which are usually in Swedish but this time they did it in English.
