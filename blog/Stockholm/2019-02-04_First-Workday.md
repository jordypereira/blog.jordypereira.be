## First Workday at ProReNata AB

Monday morning is the big meeting day of the week. At 9AM the company has breakfeast and everyone gets together. 
At 10h there's a meeting and the product team discusses everything that they will work on this week and they discuss the last week. 

I arrived at 8h20. Got a good breakfeast and attended the meetings, which are usually in Swedish but this time they did it in English.


After the meeting it was already lunch time. I went with my mentor to get some lunch to take with us and eat at the office.


The first day is mostly getting used to their worktools. It will probably be like this the whole week. I received a macbook for the 3 months I'm here and have to use webstorm. The other tools include Jira, Kanban, Trello and Github. Not too much to learn.


I've already made a very little implementation of an issue in Vue so that's great. The UX designer also uses Zeplin which makes it very easy to implement in CSS.

Cool
