I'm very happy that I got to work on a fresh project, which is seperated from the big main project.

The main project has a lot of old code and practises you have to consider, but in this New project I can help define the guidelines for further projects.

I'm working on a drag and drop template creator in Vue.js. Our javascript styles are set with eslint but the css rules are not so clear yet. I'm a big dan of Tailwind.css so I will try to implement some of that in our future.
