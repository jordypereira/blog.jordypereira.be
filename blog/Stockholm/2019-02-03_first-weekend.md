# First weekend in Stockholm

My name is Jordy Pereira, and for my internship I'm travelling to Stockholm, to help the company ProReNata with their application.  

I will primarily do frontend and code in Vue. I have found a nice appartment in Hornstull to stay at. The company is located in Gamla Stan, the old town. There are no residencies there so I will be taking the metro to work. 


Here I'll make a post each couple days on how my internship is going. Stay tuned.
