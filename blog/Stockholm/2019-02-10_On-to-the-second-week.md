## On to the second week

### Working

The first week is over. It was a very fun experience and the people working at ProReNata AB are really friendly and I get along with all of them.

Been doing a lot of meetings to understand the company, their application and the clients they work with. It's mostly a medical application for schools. That's their niche branche and it's working out quite well.

We're defining a new styleguide and since I love working with Tailwind.css, I had to mention it and try to get it in there, so I could keep working with it. I think I succeeded. The designer and CEO are with me already, so now I just have to discuss it with my mentor, the CTO.

For this new project there are a lot of issues that have been made and a roadmap that we will try to follow. One of the more difficult issues was to make the drag and drop editor.

I just finished my issue and my mentor asked me if I was up for it. I've never done something like it but I said I wanted to give it a shot. When I asked which library we would use for the drag and drop implementation, my mentor answered none. He had already made a jsfiddle with some dragging, and I could take some code from there to make it.

So that's what I've doing the last half of the week. Struggling with one big issue. Thursday I stayed till 19h because I really wanted to get it right. I'm happy to say that I finished friday at 16h with this big issue. It probably needs some more improvements but I got it working.

So I went home a bit early on friday. You can decide when you come in the office and go as long as you get 40 work hours in a week. It's a very nice work environment.

### Living

If I get food at the restaurant across the office, I pay 10 euros for a good meal. In fact the meal is more than plenty, which makes it so I can split it and eat 2 days from it. That's 5 euros a day and I've already got my big meal of the day.

This weekend I went for a walk in the northern part of Stockholm, Norrmalm. I like to just walk around and take my time. I don't really plan anything that I want to see, I just go to an area and 'explore'.

There are a lot of coffeebars here, and every one of them has a nice assortment of pastries.  

I enjoy sitting here. Yesterday I was translating the company's conversations in Slack, to learn a bit of Swedish. Seems there was a huge bug and bugfix on friday. Completely avoided that one since I was so focused on my drag and drop editor.
