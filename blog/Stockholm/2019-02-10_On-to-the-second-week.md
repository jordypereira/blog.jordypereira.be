# On to the second week

## Working

The first week is over. It was a very fun experience and the people working at ProReNata AB are really friendly and I get along with all of them.

Been doing a lot of meetings to understand the company, their application and the clients they work with. It's mostly a medical application for schools. That's their niche branche and it's working out quite well.

We're defining a new styleguide and since I love working with Tailwind.css, I had to mention it and try to get it in there, so I could keep working with it. I think I succeeded. The designer and CEO are with me already, so now I just have to discuss it with my mentor, the CTO.

For this new project there are a lot of issues that have been made and a roadmap that we will try to follow. One of the more difficult issues was to make the drag and drop editor.

I had just finished my issue and my mentor asked me if I was up for it. I've never done something like it but I said I wanted to give it a shot. When I asked which library we would use for the drag and drop implementation, my mentor told me we were going to write it from scratch. He had already made a jsfiddle with some dragging, and I could take some code from there to make it.

So that's what I've doing the last half of the week. Struggling with one big issue. Thursday I stayed till 19h because I really wanted to get it right. 

I'm happy to say that I finished it friday at 16h. It probably needs some more improvements but I got it working.

So I went home a bit early on friday. You can decide when you come in and go at the office as long as you get 40 work hours in a week. It's a very nice work environment.

## Living

If I get food at the restaurant across the office, I pay 10 euros for a good meal. In fact the meal is more than plenty, which makes it so I can split it and eat 2 days from it. That's 5 euros a day and I've already got my big meal of the day.

This weekend I went for a walk in the northern part of Stockholm, Norrmalm. I like to just walk around and take my time. I don't really plan anything that I want to see, I just go to an area and 'explore'.

There are a lot of coffeebars here, and every one of them has a nice assortment of pastries.  

I enjoy sitting here. Yesterday I was translating the company's conversations in Slack, to learn a bit of Swedish. Seems there was a huge bug and bugfix on friday. Completely avoided that one since I was so focused on my drag and drop editor.

So today I've been out on my own all day. Walked from Gamla Stan all the way up to Norrmalm, visited some shops and stayed for a bit at a coffee bar, then I walked all the way to Djurg√•rden. They have a lot of musea there. Apparantly they all close at 17h, and I was there at 16h50.

But it seems the Nordiska Museet is free on tuesdays from 13h till 17h, so I guess Tuesday is gonna be museum day. There is also a huge ship which they restored recently, together with a viking museum and an ABBA museum.

My colleagues at work told me I should try the herring. So my plan was to find a restaurant in Gamla Stan and try some fish.

The part where you see me traversing the water is where I took the ferry. 
As I arrived in Gamla Stan, I did come across some good restaurants, but it felt a bit weird going to a fancy restaurant and order fish from 28 euros all on my own.

So I found a cafe wich served a meatballs special for 10 euros. That's more my style.
